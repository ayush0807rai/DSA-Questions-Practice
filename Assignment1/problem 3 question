In the Kingdom of Numberia, the Royal Mathematician discovered a strange mirror. 
 When the matrix (scoreboard) is placed in front of this mirror: 
● Every row of the matrix gets reversed. 
● The first element becomes the last, 
● The last element becomes the first, 
● And so on… 
The King, being curious, wants you to perform this magical row reversal. 
Input 
● First line contains two integers N (rows) and M (columns). 
● Next N lines contain M integers each → the matrix. 
Output 
● Print the matrix after reversing each row. 
Constraints 
● 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100 
● -10^5 ≤ Matrix[i][j] ≤ 10^5
