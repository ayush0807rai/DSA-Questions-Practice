Problem 1: 
In the land of Numberia, there was a great Royal Tournament. 
● Each team came to compete. 
● Every row in the scoreboard represented one team. 
● Each number in the row was the score of a player from that team. 
The King of Numberia wanted to reward the best-performing team. 
But he was too busy, so he asked you — the Royal Mathematician — to help. 
Your job: 
● Find the team whose total score is the highest (row with maximum sum). 
● Report the team’s index (row number) to the King. 
● If two or more teams tie with the same score, the earliest team in the scoreboard 
should be declared the winner. 
Only then will the King crown the winning team with the Golden Abacus Trophy.

Input 
● First line contains two integers N (number of teams / rows) and M (number of 
players per team / columns). 
● Next N lines each contain M integers — the scoreboard matrix. 
Output 
● Print the index (0-based) of the team with the highest total score. 
Constraints 
● 1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100 
● -10^5 ≤ Score ≤ 10^5
